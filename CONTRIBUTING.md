Contributing to Nonprofit Board Management
===

Most importantly, thanks a ton for even thinking about contributing. You're pretty great!

To make things easier we've created these basic guidelines:

##Issues:
GitHub is for bug reports and code contributions. If you have a support question or a request for a customization go to our [Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/nonprofit-board-management) instead.

##Pull Requests:
- Please use one pull request for one bug or enhancement. This helps us merge to master more quickly and figure out how the new code affects the plugin.
- All pull requests must be made from the "master" branch. Please make sure your branch is up to date.
- Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/) and have properly documented any new functions, actions and filters following the [documentation standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/).
- Please include the purpose of your changes along with notes on how you tested the adjustments.

Thanks again for helping us make the plugin better. We really appreciate it.
